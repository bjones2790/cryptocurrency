# Cryptocurrency Predictions

This analysis looks at available cryptocurrencies in the trading market to determine how they can be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. We processed existing data to fit a unsupervised machine learning model and develop predicted outputs. We then used a clustering algorithm to chart the data and develop visualizations to present to the board. Results can be found in the attached ipynb file.
